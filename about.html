            <h1>About us</h1>
            <h3>At EasyGo, we believe everyone should have access to mobility.
                A simple solution to the most complex challenges of the world.</h3>

    <div class="section2">
        <p>We are a bunch of millennials focused on building India’s largest mobility solutions provider. Our focus has led us to build a platform providing rentals spanning across 14 states, 43 cities and 3 international cities.</p>
        <p>Transportation and mobility solutions is one of the least understood and most unorganized markets. We see this as an unexplored opportunity to build a system that can be trusted by everyone beyond barriers.</p>
        <p>We have no limitations when it comes to two wheelers and enjoy serving everything from a scooter to a superbike available on both website and mobile application.
        </p>
        <p>We are obsessed with the concept of ‘Why buy when you can rent</p>

                    <p>We procured the 1st license in kerela and decided to change the way Bike rentals worked in India. With 5 motorcycles and a pocket full of confidence the journey started.</p>

                    <p>It was not long before we shifted gears and included mopeds and scooters to our fleet, became the single largest fleet owner of rental cars and introduced the 150 – 220 cars range in the mobility market.</p>

                    <p>The concept of shared mobility picked up in India and so did our brand. We moved from 3 cities in kerela to 40+ cities across India. Launched guided tours and marked our presence in a new domain and rewrote the rules riding across South India.</p>

                    <p>History had to be rewritten and what could have been better than repeating our growth story. We became the mobility partners of Jaipur metro for last mile connectivity, grew at an annual rate of 300%, reached international locations, introduced interstate travel options etc.</p>
