This is a web project made using HTML, CSS and javascript.
To run the project, 
-> run index.html

however there are few things to be noted : 
1. date and time input system shown on home page are still being worked upon.
2. there are changes pending to take place inside about page
3. there are no functional methods for login and signup as of now, rather they are dummy buttons.
